# config-api
Config API using Directed Acyclic Graphs to support versioning


NOTE: The Config API is implemented as a microservice and requires a signed JWT from the requesting application including the accountId and userId the end user is authorized to access.

Some code for managing user accounts and login still needs to be removed.
